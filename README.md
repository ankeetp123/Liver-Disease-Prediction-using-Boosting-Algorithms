# Liver-Disease-Prediction-using-Boosting-Algorithms
Developed a machine learning model to predict Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) using seven boosting algorithms on two datasets (LDPD, ILPD). Applied data preprocessing, upsampling, and hyperparameter tuning. Evaluated models with k-fold cross-validation, achieving the best results with Gradient Boosting.
